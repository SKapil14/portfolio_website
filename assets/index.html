                <h3><ul><u>Simple Calculator named as "Calcsolve!"</u></ul></h3><br>
                <p>The "Simple C Calculator" is a basic command-line calculator program written in the C programming language.<br> 
                This mini-project allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.<br>
                It offers a user-friendly interface where users input the numbers and select the operation they want to perform.<br>
                The program then calculates the result and displays it on the screen.<br>It serves as a fundamental tool for performing quick calculations and can be extended with more advanced features in the future.<br>
                This project showcases your C programming skills and understanding of basic mathematical operations..<br>

               <h3><ul><u>Food Ordering System</u></ul></h3><br>
                <p>The "Food Ordering System in C" is a mini-project developed during the second semester of my BCA program. This command-line application allows users to browse a menu of delicious food items, make selections, and place orders.<br>
                It incorporates fundamental concepts of C programming, including data structures and file handling, to manage the menu, orders, and customer information efficiently.<br>

                <br>The system provides a user-friendly interface for customers to view available dishes, select quantities, and calculate the total cost of their order. Additionally, it allows for the customization of orders, such as specifying preferences or dietary restrictions.<br>
                    
                <br>This project not only demonstrates proficiency in C programming but also showcases the ability to design and implement a practical solution for a common real-world scenarioâ€”ordering food. It serves as a foundational stepping stone for future projects and coursework in computer science and programming.</p>
